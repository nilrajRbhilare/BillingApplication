Context

You are working on the Billing Accounting web application (Zoho Books–like UI). Several critical UX and functionality bugs exist inside the Purchases module. These are not cosmetic issues — they break core accounting workflows and must be fixed properly, not patched.

Use the attached screenshots as exact UI and behavior references (Img 2, Img 3, Img 4, Img 5).
Do not change routes, ports, or business logic, only fix broken navigation, layout, and visibility issues.

1️⃣ Purchases → Expenses → Edit is NOT working (CRITICAL FUNCTIONAL BUG)
Problem

Clicking Sidebar → Purchases → Expenses → Edit

Either:

Nothing happens, or

Partial page loads, or

Edit screen opens but fields are not populated / not usable

This breaks a core accounting action (editing recorded expenses)

Required Behavior (Reference: Img 2 & Img 3)

Clicking Edit from:

Expense list OR

Expense details right panel
must open a fully functional Edit Expense screen

The Edit Expense screen must:

Load existing expense data correctly

Allow editing all fields

Save changes successfully and reflect updates in the expense list

Fields That MUST Work

Ensure all fields are editable and bound correctly:

Date

Expense Account

Amount (INR)

Paid Through

Expense Type (Goods / Services)

HSN Code

Vendor

GST Treatment

Source of Supply

Destination of Supply

Reverse Charge checkbox

Tax selection

Tax Inclusive / Exclusive toggle

Invoice #

Notes

Customer Name

Functional Expectations

Edit button must:

Trigger correct route/navigation

Pass correct expense ID

Pre-fill form using backend data

Save / Save & New must:

Persist updated values

Redirect back correctly

Show updated data in list & detail view

❌ Do NOT leave placeholders like “Edit functionality coming soon”
❌ Do NOT reload blank forms
✅ This must behave like a real accounting system, not a mock UI

2️⃣ Purchases → Purchase Orders → Right-side Blank Space (LAYOUT BUG)
Problem (Reference: Img 4)

On Purchases → Purchase Orders

There is a large unused blank space / margin / padding on the right side

This wastes screen real estate and makes the UI look broken and unprofessional

Required Fix

Remove unnecessary:

Right margin

Padding

Empty containers

Grid columns reserving unused space

The Purchase Order list and details should:

Expand naturally to available width

Align consistently with sidebar and header

Not leave dead UI areas

Constraints

Do NOT change:

Sidebar width

Page structure

Routing logic

Only fix layout spacing issues using proper container sizing and overflow handling

Expected Result

Clean, balanced layout

No empty white blocks on the right

Purchase Order content uses full available width

3️⃣ Purchase Orders → New & Edit → Item Table Not Displaying Properly (HIGH IMPACT UI BUG)
Problem (Reference: Img 5)

In New Purchase Order and Edit Purchase Order screens:

Item Table is:

Cropped

Misaligned

Partially hidden

Columns overflow or collapse

This makes it impossible to properly add/edit items

Item Table Sections That MUST Be Fully Visible

Ensure proper layout and visibility for:

Item Details

Account

Quantity

Rate

Tax

Amount

Bulk Actions

Delete / Action icons

Required Fixes

Ensure:

Table container has proper width handling

Horizontal scrolling works if needed

Columns do not overflow or overlap

No field goes outside its defined boundary

Fix responsiveness so the table:

Works on standard desktop resolutions

Doesn’t break alignment when resizing

Structural Expectations

Item table must look and behave like a production-grade accounting UI

All rows, headers, and input fields must:

Stay inside the container

Be clickable and editable

Update amounts dynamically

❌ Do NOT hide columns
❌ Do NOT shrink text to unreadable sizes
✅ Make layout robust instead of hacky
