Context

In multiple modules (e.g. Payments Received → Record Payment, Expenses → Record Expense / Record Mileage), the create forms open inside modal dialogs.

These modals apply:

Margins from all sides

Max-width constraints

Background overlays

Internal scroll containers

As a result, the pages do not utilize full screen space and look inconsistent with other create pages like Create Invoice.

Modules Affected (Not Limited To)

Sales → Payments Received → Record Payment

Purchases → Expenses → Record Expense

Purchases → Expenses → Record Mileage

Any other primary “New / Create” flows currently using modals

Current Incorrect Behavior

Create forms open in modal/popups

Margins exist on all sides

Page never covers full width/height

Sidebar is visually disconnected

UX is inconsistent across the application

This behavior is wrong for primary business workflows.

Expected Correct Behavior

For all primary create flows:

❌ No modal/dialog

❌ No overlay or backdrop

❌ No max-width restrictions

❌ No forced margins from any side

✅ Sidebar remains visible

✅ Content starts immediately after sidebar

✅ Form occupies 100% of available width & height

✅ Layout matches full-page create screens (e.g. Create Invoice)

Correct layout pattern:

| Sidebar | Full-Page Create Form |

Mandatory Implementation Requirements

Completely remove modal/dialog usage

Do not reuse modal components

Do not hide modal using CSS

Modal wrapper must not exist in DOM

Use route-based or page-level rendering

Examples:

/payments-received/new

/expenses/new

/expenses/mileage/new

Use a shared full-page layout container

Same layout used by:

Create Invoice

Create Credit Note

Create Sales Order

Layout rules

Width: 100%

Height: full viewport

No max-width

No outer margin/padding (except standard page padding)

No overlay or dim background

Business logic

Reuse existing form fields and validations

Only change how the form is rendered, not its logic

What MUST NOT Be Done

❌ Do NOT increase modal width

❌ Do NOT reduce modal padding

❌ Do NOT remove backdrop only

❌ Do NOT apply CSS hacks on modal

❌ Do NOT keep modal structure hidden

If a modal exists, the fix is invalid.

Acceptance Criteria

All primary create forms open as full pages

No margin from any side

Sidebar always visible

UI consistent across all modules

No modal or overlay anywhere for create flows
