Multiple issues in Sales, Delivery Challan, and Customers modules.

1) Sales Order → Invoice History & Zero Values Issue

Modules:
- Sales Order
- Invoice (created from Sales Order)

Steps:
- Open any Sales Order
- Convert to Invoice → Convert to all invoices
- Invoice is created and visible in the Invoices section (sidebar)

Issues:
- Created invoices are not visible in the Sales Order → Invoice history.
- In the generated invoice, the following values are shown as 0:
  - Sub Total: ₹0.00
  - Total: ₹0.00
  - Balance Due: ₹0.00

Expected:
- Invoice history should be visible under the Sales Order.
- Sub Total, Total, and Balance Due should be calculated correctly.

Actual:
- Invoice history missing.
- Monetary values shown as zero.

Impact:
- Broken traceability between Sales Order and Invoice
- Financial mismatch


2) Issues in Delivery Challan

Modules:
- New Delivery Challan
- Edit Delivery Challan

Issues:
a) Item pricing issue  
- Item rate is fetched incorrectly.

Example:
Item: HP ProDesk Desktop  
Item Master Price: ₹45,000.00  
Rate shown: ₹45.00  

Expected:
- Rate should be fetched exactly from Item Master.

Actual:
- Rate is reduced to ₹45.00.

b) Edit Delivery Challan – Item selection issue  
- Items are not selectable or fetched in Edit Delivery Challan.
- Item dropdown does not load correctly.

Expected:
- Items should be selectable and fetched properly in Edit Delivery Challan.

Actual:
- Item list does not populate.


3) Customers List – Columns Issue

Module:
- Customers

Issues:
- "Unused Credits (BCY)" column should be removed from the Customers list.
- "Receivables (BCY)" column is always showing ₹0.00 even when transactions exist.

Expected:
- Unused Credits (BCY) column should be removed.
- Receivables (BCY) should display correct outstanding amounts per customer.

Actual:
- Unused Credits column is visible unnecessarily.
- Receivables column always shows ₹0.00.

Impact:
- Incorrect customer financial summary
- Misleading receivables data

Please resolve the above issues across Sales Order → Invoice flow, Delivery Challan item handling, and Customers list column data.
