In Sales → e-Way Bills, when the “New e-Way Bill” screen opens, the e-Way Bills list/table remains visible on the left, creating an unwanted middle section between the sidebar and the New e-Way Bill form.

This is incorrect behavior.

The list view must NOT be visible when creating a new e-Way Bill.

Current (Incorrect) Behavior

Sidebar is visible ✅

e-Way Bills list/table is still visible ❌

New e-Way Bill form opens on the right ❌

Result:
Sidebar | e-Way Bills List (UNWANTED) | New e-Way Bill Form

This creates confusion and wasted space.

Expected (Correct) Behavior

When New e-Way Bill is opened:

✅ Sidebar remains visible
❌ e-Way Bills list/table is completely hidden
✅ New e-Way Bill form should start immediately after the sidebar
✅ The New e-Way Bill form should occupy the full remaining width

Correct layout should be:

Sidebar | New e-Way Bill Form (FULL WIDTH)

Implementation Requirements (IMPORTANT)

When New e-Way Bill mode is active:

Do NOT render the e-Way Bills list/table component

OR conditionally hide it using state/route-based rendering

Ensure this logic applies only during:

Create New e-Way Bill

Edit e-Way Bill (if applicable)

When New e-Way Bill is closed:

Restore the list/table view normally

Technical Hints (Don’t Ignore This)

This is a conditional rendering / routing issue, not CSS alone

Likely causes:

List and form both rendered inside the same parent layout

Missing condition like:

isCreateMode

route check (/eway-bills/new)

Fix should be at:

Page-level layout

Route-level component switch

NOT with hacks like display:none unless unavoidable

Acceptance Criteria

No list/table visible when New e-Way Bill is open

No empty or “middle” section

Clean, professional, single-focus UI

Same behavior should apply consistently across:

Items → New Item

Credit Notes → Create

Any create/edit right-panel screens

Important Note (Read Carefully)

If someone tries to fix this using only:

margin

padding

width

👉 they are fixing the symptom, not the cause.

The cause is incorrect layout composition.
