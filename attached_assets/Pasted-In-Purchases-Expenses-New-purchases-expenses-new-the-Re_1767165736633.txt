In Purchases → Expenses → New (/purchases/expenses/new), the Record Expense / Record Mileage screen currently opens inside a modal/dialog overlay.

Because it is rendered inside a modal:

Margins are applied from all sides

A max-width constraint exists

Background content is dimmed

The form never occupies full screen width/height

This behavior is inconsistent with other full-page create flows like Create Invoice and Create Credit Note.

Current Incorrect Behavior

Expense creation opens as a popup modal

Left, right, top, and bottom spacing exists

Modal scroll is applied instead of page scroll

Sidebar feels disconnected

Screen space is wasted

This is not acceptable for a primary create workflow.

Expected Correct Behavior

When opening Purchases → Expenses → New:

❌ No modal / dialog component

❌ No overlay or backdrop

❌ No max-width container

❌ No forced margins from any side

✅ Sidebar remains visible

✅ Content starts immediately after sidebar

✅ Expense form occupies 100% available width and height

✅ Layout matches other full-page create screens (e.g. Create Invoice)

Final layout must be:

| Sidebar | New Expense (Full Page Form) |

Mandatory Implementation Requirements

Completely remove modal/dialog usage

Do not reuse modal components

Do not hide modal with CSS

Modal wrapper must not exist in the DOM

Use route-based page rendering

Route example: /purchases/expenses/new

Render the expense form as a normal page, not a popup

Use the same base page layout container used by:

Create Invoice

Create Credit Note

Other full-page create/edit screens

Layout rules

Width: 100%

Height: full viewport

No max-width

No outer margins from any side

Only standard page padding (same as Create Invoice)

Form behavior

Record Expense and Record Mileage must work inside the same full-page layout

Existing form logic, validations, and API calls must remain unchanged

Only the layout and rendering method should change

What MUST NOT Be Done

❌ Do NOT increase modal width

❌ Do NOT reduce modal padding

❌ Do NOT remove backdrop only

❌ Do NOT apply CSS hacks on modal

❌ Do NOT keep modal structure hidden

If a modal exists in any form, the fix is incorrect.

Acceptance Criteria

purchases/expenses/new opens as a full-page screen

No margins from any side

No overlay or background dimming

Sidebar remains visible

Layout and spacing match Create Invoice

Full screen space is utilized properly

Reference

Use Create Invoice as the single layout reference for:

Width

Height

Spacing

Page behavior

Do not use the existing Expense modal as reference.
