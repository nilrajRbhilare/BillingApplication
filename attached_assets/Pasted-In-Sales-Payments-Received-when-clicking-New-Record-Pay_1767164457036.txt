In Sales → Payments Received, when clicking New / Record Payment, the form currently opens inside a modal/dialog overlay.

Because it is rendered inside a modal:

Margins are applied on all sides

Max-width restrictions exist

Background is dimmed

The page never occupies full available space

Even after layout changes, the issue persists because the modal container itself is still present.

Current Incorrect Behavior

Record Payment opens as a popup modal

Left, right, top, and bottom spacing exists

Page does not stretch edge-to-edge

Background list remains dimmed

UX is inconsistent with other create pages

This behavior is wrong and unacceptable.

Expected Correct Behavior

When New / Record Payment is opened:

❌ No modal

❌ No dialog wrapper

❌ No backdrop / overlay

❌ No max-width or forced margins

✅ Sidebar remains visible

✅ Page content starts immediately after sidebar

✅ Form occupies 100% of available width and height

✅ Layout matches Create Invoice / Create Credit Note pages

Final layout must be:

| Sidebar | Record Payment – Full Page Form |

Mandatory Implementation Requirements

Completely remove modal/dialog usage

Do not reuse modal component

Do not hide modal with CSS

Do not keep modal wrapper in DOM

Use route-based page rendering

Example route: /payments-received/new

Render Record Payment as a normal page, not a popup

Use the same base layout wrapper as:

Create Invoice

Create Credit Note

Create Sales Order

Layout rules

Width: 100%

Height: full viewport

No max-width

No outer margins from left/right/top/bottom

Only standard page padding (same as other create pages)

Form behavior

Reuse existing form fields and logic

Invoice Payment & Customer Advance must work in the same page

Only the container/layout changes

What Must NOT Be Done (Critical)

❌ Do NOT adjust modal padding

❌ Do NOT increase modal width

❌ Do NOT remove backdrop only

❌ Do NOT rely on CSS hacks

❌ Do NOT keep modal structure in any form

If a modal exists, the fix is incorrect.

Acceptance Criteria

Record Payment opens as a full-page screen

No margins on any side

No overlay or dimmed background

Sidebar remains visible

UI and spacing identical to Create Invoice

Covers entire available content area

Reference

Use Create Invoice page as the exact layout reference for:

Width

Height

Spacing

Page behavior

Do not use the current Record Payment screen as reference.
